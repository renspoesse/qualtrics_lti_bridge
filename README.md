This Qualtrics LTI Bridge tool was developed by Rens Poesse for the University of Amsterdam.

It has been based on qualtrics_lti_bridge by Simon Wiles at Stanford University,
which is accessible at the link [tiny.cc/qualtricslti](http://tiny.cc/qualtricslti).

The main goal for developing this tool was to build a way by which Qualtrics surveys can be included
in a Coursera course for the purpose of A/B testing. However, the tool has more general LTI use cases
as can be read here:

Another important goal of this project is to provide clear documentation and code comments to ensure
usefulness of the tool for anyone interested in using Qualtrics with other platforms in educational scenarios.
